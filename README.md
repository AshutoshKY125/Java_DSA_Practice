LeetCode Problem of the Day – My Journey
========================================

Welcome to my LeetCode Problem of the Day (POTD) repository!This is my personal commitment to solving one LeetCode problem every day and documenting not just the final solution, but the entire journey of reaching it.

What You’ll Find Here
---------------------

Each problem/day has its own folder with:

*   **story.md** – My complete journey for that problem. It includes:
    
    *   The initial intuition
        
    *   Iteration codes
        
    *   Mistakes and learnings
        
    *   Final solution and key takeaways
        
*   **code.java** – The final accepted solution with detailed comments.
    
*   **screenshot.png** – A snapshot of the successful submission on LeetCode.
    

Why This Repo Exists
--------------------

There are already plenty of places to find correct LeetCode solutions.This repo is different – it’s about:

*   Documenting the real learning process, including failed attempts and corrections.
    
*   Building a strong daily habit of problem-solving.
    
*   Reflecting on mistakes and the insights that shaped my growth.
    

As the saying goes:“Every expert was once a beginner who refused to give up.”
